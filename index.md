Hello there!

My name is Ashish Panigrahi. I'm a 4th year physics major studying under the Integrated Master's programme at the [National Institute of Science Education and Research](https://www.niser.ac.in) under [HBNI](http://www.hbni.ac.in/). My research interests lie in the experimental aspects of quantum technologies research ranging from quantum optics/information processing to cavity quantum-electrodynamics. I am actively seeking research internship opportunities for summer 2022.

I did my Bachelor's [thesis](assets/files/thesis.pdf) with [Dr. Kartik Senapati](https://www.niser.ac.in/users/kartik#profile-main)'s group on spin Hall effect in NM/HM trilayer systems in fall 2021 during which I became a [Qiskit advocate](https://qiskit.org/advocates/). You can find my full CV [here](assets/files/cv.pdf).

If you have any questions, suggestions, advice or simply wish to discuss about topics that relate to me, feel free to contact me via [email](mailto:ashish.panigrahi@niser.ac.in).
