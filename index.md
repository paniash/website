Hello there!

My name is Ashish Panigrahi. I'm a final year physics masters student at the
[National Institute of Science Education and Research](https://www.niser.ac.in) in
India. My research interests lie in the field of quantum photonics, broadly
investigating quantum interaction between light and matter in solid-state devices.
The goal is to study photonic nanostructures to create hardware for applications in
quantum technologies.

I am currently working on the manipulation of nuclear spins in
cryogenically cooled GaAs quantum dots for my masters thesis. I did my [Bachelors
thesis](assets/files/thesis.pdf) with [Dr. Kartik
Senapati](https://www.niser.ac.in/users/kartik#profile-main)'s group on spin Hall
effect in NM/HM trilayer systems in spring 2021 during which I became an [IBM Qiskit
advocate](https://qiskit.org/advocates/). You can find my full CV
[here](assets/files/cv.pdf).

I am happy to discuss and collaborate on related areas. Please feel free to contact
me via [email](mailto:ashish.panigrahi@niser.ac.in).
