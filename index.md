Hello there!

My name is Ashish Panigrahi. I'm a 4th year physics major studying under the Integrated Master's programme at the [National Institute of Science Education and Research](https://www.niser.ac.in) under [HBNI](http://www.hbni.ac.in/). I am interested in the experimental aspects of quantum optics and quantum computing. I am actively seeking research internship opportunities for summer 2022.

I did my Bachelor's [thesis](assets/files/thesis.pdf) with [Dr. Kartik Senapati](https://www.niser.ac.in/users/kartik#profile-main)'s group on spin Hall effect in NM/HM trilayer systems in fall 2021 during which I became a [Qiskit advocate](https://qiskit.org/advocates/).

If you have any questions, suggestions, advice or simply wish to discuss about topics that relate to me, feel free to contact me via [email](mailto:ashish.panigrahi@niser.ac.in). See [here](contact/) for more detail.

For academic details, see my [CV](assets/files/resume.pdf).
