# Week 1: Hunt for Literature

I am fortunate enough to be selected for a summer internship program at the
[Australian National University](https://anu.edu.au). I'll be working with the
quantum optics group under Prof. Dr. Larry Lu. This blog post is a way to be
accountable to myself and keep a track on my progress throughout the summer as weekly
updates.

At the moment, I'll be working remotely due to an ongoing delay in my visa
application (sigh). The work involves writing a review paper on *Spontaneous
Parametric Down Conversion (SPDC) based on nonlinear 2D materials*. My plan is to
provide a written account on my process of writing the same, which I hope will be
useful for anyone else intending on writing a review paper.

First task of the week: gather key references on the topic and make notes on the
general trends, keywords, and methods observed in these references. Still trying to
figure out a systematic way to do so, but hopefully should be done by the end of the
weekend. Cheers!
